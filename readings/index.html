              1. 

When giving a critique it's often difficult for me to not creative direct the project with my feedback. I try to give feedback which is specific but in our field it's a little bit of a balancing act to give enough but not too much to influence the project with personal opinions. However, it also depends fully on the circumstances. If you're with a team working on a single project and giving critique to another designer on your team, then I feel that it's more acceptable to comment on specifics and maybe give some creative opinions as well. Outside of that though, I need to work on giving constructive criticism and leading questions without influencing the other designer's project. 

 

I also sometimes face the challenge of trying to be critical without coming off as too harsh. I try to be blunt and honest with my critiques while trying to be encouraging as to not hurt any feelings (we are all creatives at the end of the day). I think it's important to be respectful and professional with critiques.

When I receive a critique that I disagree with I tend to ask more follow up questions. Why they are saying what they are saying, how they came to that conclusion and from what perspective they see it. I’m the type of person that loves getting critique on my work and I often bug my friends to try and point out flaws in my work that I can fix. So when I get critique I disagree with I do the follow up questions and I try to ask a couple more people I know, some who are into design, some who have no idea what I’m talking about and then average together the opinions. It’s important when designing something that is functional and has a purpose to test on a variety of people. It's also important to try and see the critique from their perspective. So that's how I handle with a critique I disagree with. First, I ask questions, then I ask more people and then I try to see if from their perspective and then end up making a decision on the design. This is an ideal scenario when I have time. If I disagree I may just refuse and thank them for their critique, or accept it after thinking about it more.

It's important to give and receive critique because we as humans don't live in a vacuum. We as designers do not live in a vacuum. If it wasn't for other people viewing our work, would our work even exist? Design is a form of visual communication and it's important to gauge if such communication is effective, appropriate and aesthetically pleasing. Most of the time, it helps to have multiple minds on a project versus one. Say if you were working on a group project in a team at a studio, you would delegate tasks to certain people who excel in those areas rather than shouldering the entire project on one person. Same goes for critique, we give critique from various people in various areas of expertise to come to a final conclusion of a project. If we did everything ourselves without any opinion then the work will not be as effective or interesting.

               Reading Two:<br> <br> 
               1. As somebody using Apple products for most of my life, I remember back in the early days when all the icons were in the skeuomorphic style. Once iOS 7 was released along with Google's Material Design - it felt fresh and clean. Back then, phones weren't as integral to our lives as they are now, and there seemed to be a trend towards minimalism in design and in all aspects of life in general. Perhaps because of the socio-economical circumstances of the time post recession or the effort the corporations were putting in to portray themselves as "friendly" in order to manipulate their consumers into sharing their precious data more willingly. Whatever the case, flat design came and took over all aspects of our digital with every passing year and around mid 2010s it started to become that "corporate" aesthetic that we know far too well now. Lucas Sharp has a brilliant article about the corporate style that was used in the Clinton campaign and which is very interesting, I will attach it below. Regardless, what I've noticed in particular after a year long pandemic that has been difficult on all of us, is a return to that imperfect nature of Skeuomorphic design in a different form. Neumorphism is a mix of that flat and skeuomorphic design that keeps the minimal clutter of flat design, while adding that depth and humanity back to the design. If you take a look at macOS Big Sur for example - many feel like it's ugly or find it weird but I believe that the platforms that we designers work on are extremely influential to our work subconsciously and it's certain that trends will take us this way. I think things are going to be far more colourful, exciting and interactive than ever before and with the different ways we interact with our technology now (VR, AR etc.) we can't only design for the screen anymore. My hope is that with the maturing of neumorphism and friendly design, the 2020s will have technology feel far more intuitive and "alive" than ever before and after such a hard year, we can bring back the fun in design like the old days.

Zoopraxiscopes were priced high speed photographers spinning radially on a disc while lit from behind, resulting in motion. It relates to digital design because it's kind of like a GIF. Maybe it could be related to motion design in general and the interactive nature of the web or even the nature of the screen. It's meant to change and constantly be updating. Another example of filmmaking that changed the web I would say is the VLOG. The VLOG might not be a "film" per se but it is derived from film making and reflecting on your personal life. I think that could also be applied to the impact of social media and how that's changed the web. Twitter/Tiktok in a sense is like short form VLOG.

I agree that screens want flux. Screens are a static piece of technology but what is on them have infinite potential to change, so I believe it would be a waste for screens not to want flux. There is no right way of using technology but if there is no flux, is the technology even useful? Imagine if a computer was just static on a screen all the time or had no dynamic elements. Flux goes back to the human nature I was talking about back in the first question response, the dynamic nature of animations, malleability of the software is what calls back to human nature and makes it feel intuitive to use. Action and reaction. You do something and you see a change happen, and that's what makes computers enjoyable to work on.

               Reading Three: <br> <br> I believe that Lialina may be skeptical of replacing the word ‘user’ with ‘people’. Her attitude towards the topic becomes clear through her arguments in the text where she claims that “in a broader context, the denial of the word user in favor of people becomes dangerous.” She then follows this up with “being a user is the last reminder that there is, whether visible or not, a computer, a programmed system you use”. Here, Lialina is stressing the importance of the difference between user and developer and how that difference would be lost if we stopped referring to users as users. She goes on to state that if we lose the distinction between users and people, users may lose their rights and the opportunity to protect them. She mentions some of these rights such as demanding better software and the ability to delete your files. So in summary, Lialina is skeptical of replacing the word ‘user’ because she believes that developers may take advantage of the users rights. She prefers there to be a difference.
 

               Lialina defines the ideal internet user as “The Universal User” or “The Turing Complete User”. This is a reference to the Universal Turing Machine. The qualities of the universal user are that they will find a way to their aspiration without apps or utilities specifically programmed for it. For example, a universal user would “decide not to use Twitter at all and instead inform the world about your breakfast through your own website.” The point that Lialina is trying to drive home in this section of the reading is for the reader to imagine the possibilities of such a user. The idea is that you can use tools in ways that they weren’t made for to suit your own needs. Fashioning together miscellaneous software to create your own workhorse to get your things done. Instead of trying to micromanage every single interaction on the developer’s end, why not respect the intelligence of the user and the fact that they are in fact using your software and are not living with it. That distinction needs to be made. Software is to be used by users.
                
               
               In my own experience with the web I think gaps are filled by users all the time. Personally, as a resourceful person –I tend to use the web and software for my own needs rather than what it was specifically designed for. Since Lialina used Twitter as an example, I will do the same for my first use case. Before Twitter introduced the bookmarks feature I would like a series of tweets that I wanted to go back to and I would click through my likes and find a tweet that I had saved. For my second example, this is a big throwback but back in the day there used to be a game called cookie clicker and the whole premise of this game was to keep clicking the cookie and try to get a higher score than your friends. It was just a counter, and you could upgrade your cookie etc. Similar to maybe a balloon tower defense game. Back then instead of clicking the cookie I would go online and find an auto clicker and have that just run and I would go about my daily life while beating my friends in the game. Another example is an addon I used many years ago when YouTube counted views based on refreshes. I would have my browser keep refreshing and boosting my views on my channel. Another example would be mixing music. Sometimes I would play an original song on YouTube, and then a cover just to have both singers on almost a duet. There are so many use cases but I feel like nowadays everyone is just locked into their ecosystems of Twitter, IG, Reddit whatever… That magic of the young web has been lost and these companies have monopolized their industries. I hope as the web matures there is a resurgence in niche websites that were just about having fun like back in the day.

               Reading Four: Laurel Schwulst seems to advocate for individual websites over social media in order to return the web to it's original creative, active, personal state. In simple terms, make the web fun like it used to be. She mentions the usual culprits such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Pinterest and reminds the reader that they "are private companies that prioritize advertising above their users' needs". Schwulst is driving home the point that the web can be so much more flexibile if users were willing to create their own websites outsite of the predetermined systems that are already in place and are "socially acceptable". I totally agree with her points. The web has become so dry compared to ten years ago. Most websites live right now either look like a squarespace template or are big social media corpos. Why not ditch that corporate style together? Instead why not make a website that's like your own home with your own tastes; something worn in, something comfortable. Everybody is unique and the whole point of the web is for everybody so add something of their own to make it whole. I think there needs to be a way to make building a website more accessible outside of the squarespaces of the world. Let's get rid of the concept of templates and come up with something modular and easy to use (without underestimating the intelligence of our audience). Something that annoys me to no end in era of technology is designers dumbing everything down to what they assume is "simple" for the average citizen. Apple did this back in the day and they did a great job but that was for a difference purpose. Now that most people are technologically literate, having designers make everything as simple as possible feels like gatekeeping. To design a website using prebuilt tools, you have to jump through a myriad of loopholes and annoying "stupid-proof" protections. I think the solution to improving and individualizing the web is to make creating a website simple and powerful, not simple and stupid.

               Reading Five: <br> <br> 1. From my understanding of the text, I believe Mindy Seu intends us to think outside of autonomy. To forget what we've been told about our tools and how they're supposed to be "invisible". By 'defamiliarizing our tools' we can acknowledge the interfaces that are usually utilitarian, as a thing of deeper meaning, or maybe even not! Like the examples that are shared throughout the article, Mindy walks us through different types of art that focus on things like data, all the way to artificial intelligence. Now, this is interesting because all it takes is to look at things from a bit of a different perspective. I think this is what Mindy is trying to share with the reader. This perspective that she has. When I look at the examples provided and think deeper about my own experiences with computers, it makes me think, there is actually something poetic about the tools we use. There are all these systems that are meant to be invisible and just to be a "blank canvas" for the users, but once you actually take a good look at them, they are in fact quite poetic. The Google Translate example was interesting to me. It's incredible to just take a step back and think about how each culture interprets things differently and how this tool that we collectively put together in a multicultural country, is it's own interpretations (in the least biased way possible) of those cultures from the viewpoint of the programmers. What this text also got me thinking of is how changing these tools effects future art? For example we can see some big operating system changes coming in the form of macOS Big Sur and Windows 11. If these are our so called "tools", how do you think they would subconsciously impact the art we create? Since we spend so much time using these tools. These are all interesting considerations to make and bringing the tools to the forefront of discussion is definitely an important and interesting way to look at things. 

               2. My interpretation of the "performing data" segment was looking at data through a different lens and parsing that data into some form of art or presentation. Using data in a way maybe that it wasn't meant to be used in, in order to look at it from a third person outside the lens of a "tool". I found an interesting website https://showyourstripes.info/ (Links to an external site.) that "performs data" in the sense that it takes the colours of your country flag and interprets them into a bar graph about climate change. Each set of data isn't used for it's original purpose but it's refashioned into this flag and presented in this way that makes it interesting and more digestable to someone who is maybe interested in climate change. I think looking at data outside of a utilitarian viewpoint alone is an art in itself. Interpreting data and presenting it in clever and digestible ways is an amazing art form and also a very important one. Imagine if we had to go through raw data for everything we wanted to know about. It's the "performing" part of performing data that is the most important, because what is the point in data if nobody can understand it.
