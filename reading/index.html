        <h2> A website is like a bookshelf full of unique personality. 
            Each book could be a page while the shelf itself it the site. 
        As you know, there are billions of books in the world containing the thoughts of billions of individuals who were alive throughout time.
    A website could be a digital repository of ideas, housed in books on a shelf that is your soul. Your unique experiences, your unique passions, your creativity.
There's infinite potential. This is the beauty of the web. It is not constrained to the physical world. I can make this bookshelf as small or large as I want to and fill it with infinite ideas and experiences to pass onto others.
A website can be the digital metaphor of a bookshelf for your life. </h2>
